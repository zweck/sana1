# Sana

## Part 1

### Chapter 1 

Sana stumbles out of her bed. Her room is a mess. She hits the button and her bed slides away giving her access to her wardrobe. Space is a premium in Tokonoya and her lowly analyst salary only just gets her a studio in the city. Still, better than living in the barren wastes between metropolises. 

She throws on some clothes whilst making her way into the kitchen, dining, living space. Her holopet dog looks hungry "Akata, how many holopet tokens do I have?", "443 came the voice in her head".

The implant was placed in every kid at school from the age of 12. Originally sold to parents as optional and a great way to keep track of their little precious, it quickly became a convenient and mandatory way for a state to gather mass data about it’s subjects. This was Sana’s job. She worked for the Interior Ministry monitoring feeds and investigating unusual patterns. Speaking of which, "shit, I’m late! Akata, feed the dog 1 bone and give him water, oh and I need a ride to work".

She slams the door on the way out and rushes down from her apartment to the street. By the time she gets there a car appears. She dives in and gets her screen out whilst being driven to work. 

She starts flicking through her todos for the day. Something catches her eye. She sees her apartment complex listed amongst the highlighted cases. A few taps later she’s in the case files. Dr Soum, works for the national grid, good job with a family, pays their taxes on time each month, took a trip on his own to the border last week and was gone for 2 days. 

"I don’t remember seeing that face in my apartment". The car slows at some lights. Even though it’s morning the density of the city shrouds out the sun, neon lights glow in the damp rainy autumn day. "Akata, join my morning meeting".

"Ha. And you worked on it for a _week_!". Sana had joined the meeting late and Kirosan, her boss, was halfway through some banter with her colleague. "Sorry I’m late guys, how are we all this morning?", a chorus of agreeable tones came her way. "Ok, looking at the days schedule we all have something assigned other than me. Kirosan sir, I was thinking of picking up the Dr Soum case, unless you have something specific you want me to look at?".

"Yes yes Sana, that’s fine". 

"Ok see you in a bit. I’m just on my way in". Akata cut Sana off automatically. She’s starts moving again, and pulls up more details about Soum’s case. It was flagged by the intelligence agency when his implant alerted them to his proximity to the border. "Interesting, he took a small detour to a waste disposal site a few kilometres from the edge of the city".

Sana arrives at the office. 

It’s a huge building. In the centre of the city along with all the other major government departments. Only official vehicles are allowed in the ever growing ministry district, yet another advantage of the implant. Enables automatic authorization of visitors.

The city was divided into residential and worker districts with worker districts divided by ministry, utilities and factory districts. 

The building had a metal facia, it was in a poor state of repair with rust and mould growing on the outside. Dim lights from the surrounding floor lit the dank exterior, the rain was bouncing off the ground. Sana ran from the car into the building. Holding her screen over her head. She walks through the turnstile to meet Kirosan in the foyer, shaking off the rain as she goes. 

"What do you have so far on this Soum case then?"

He knew she would have been researching it on the trip in. 

"Not much sir, he stopped off at a waste site 2km outside of the city centre, I was gonna start there". 

"Sounds good. Sana. Do you know him? It isn’t lost on me that he lives in the same apartment as you".

"Nope. Actually I don’t even remember seeing his face"

"Ok. I look forward to tomorrow’s update. I’m popping out for lunch with a junior minister. Gotta keep the paymasters happy".

Sana makes her way to her desk. Her department is on the 17th floor, when she arrives she sees a few colleagues from the morning call. The floor is pretty empty. Her department has been shrinking for the last few years, not for lack of applicants. Everyone leaves university with the same degree, and then choose which government department they want to work for. Problem is that they all need training as soon as they walk through the door. Which leaves all the work on the few fully trained analysts, the team of which Sana heads up. 

She docks her screen and sits at her desk. Grabbing the CCTV from the waste plant from the government database she starts scrubbing through to find the right time. The imaging database is a mess. Obscure tech from centuries ago storing millions of hours of footage from millions of cameras throughout the city. 

### Chapter 2

"Hello? Hello?! Can anyone hear me?" Dr Baru Soum couldn’t feel or see anything. He tried to move his hands but couldn’t feel them, likewise his legs. "HELP!!" He couldn’t hear anything. Not even an echo. He started to panic, what on earth is going on. Why can’t he see, feel or move?! Then all goes dark. 

### Chapter 3

Sana’s eyes glaze over, 4 hours searching for footage of the waste plant. And nothing. Sure it was easy enough to find something from there. But nothing at the right angle, or on the right day. She may have to put in an escalated request for an interdepartmental data dump. Either way, it was time to grab lunch. 

Most days Sana just used the food machines on level 8. They print food from a bunch of base materials. But today she fancied something fresh. Preferably noodles. 

She leaves the ministry building and makes her way down a busy street. Although only Ministry employees are allowed in this district, that still encompasses a huge percentage of the city. 

Turning a corner she spots her favourite noodle stand. "Hey, dry noodle in chilli oil" Akata pays with her food tokens. Fresh noodles are pretty expensive these days, so Sana limits it to once or twice a month. But they taste so good that it’s worth the expense. Something about the imperfections of real food that makes it unique. 

It’s still raining but not as heavily as before, she spots a sheltered nook under some over-hangings that looks dry enough. Leaning against the wall she takes digs into her noodles. The case of Dr Soum rattling through her mind. 

"Akata, make a request to the information ministry for all CCTV footage from the waste site for the hours Dr Soum was there’s. Padded out a couple hours just in case".

"Request sent Sana".

The information ministry works pretty quickly, they have thousands of grunts processing these requests, and her employee ID will carry some weight which should speed things up. 

Akata: "Request rejected Sana. You lack authorization to see these files".

"What!" She blurted out. Much to the surprise of people around her. "Call the information ministry!"

Switchboard: "Good afternoon, how may I direct your call?"

"Information requests, interdepartmental requests".

"Hello Sana, my name is Keyba, are you enquiring about your recent request?"

"Yes, why was it denied?"

"The footage you have requested is missing or otherwise inaccessible, I can escalate to my manager if you like?"

"Please"

Whilst Sana waits for the manager she’s made her way to her desk. She starts searching through the database from her end. She can see that there’s data around that date, "god damn why is it so hard to find anything!" 

"Hello Sana? My manager has said that the data is missing and that it’s been raised through the proper channels. Sorry I couldn’t be of any more help".

Akata: "call ended"

"Akata, call Kirosan".

"No answer Sana" came the mechanical Akata. 

"Fuck!" Sana had a short fuse, and roadblocks were a sure fired way to light it. 

She looks back at her desk. "Dr Soum, what are you up to" she murmurs "nothing for it. I might as well go visit his family". 

### Chapter 4

Suddenly Soum was bathed in light. Excruciatingly bright and all encompassing. Images started streaming in. He was in a dank room, an operating theatre of sorts. He felt a twinge on his arm. Looking down he saw wires coming out of him, coming out of him all over, his arms, chest, face. He panicked. Tried to move his hands. And blacked out. 

### Chapter 5

Sana arrives home, Apartment 3 for the Soum’s. She hesitates for a second, then asks Akata if anyone is home. 

"3 occupants are home Sana. Shall I alert Mrs Soum to your presence?"

"Yes please"

A few seconds later the door opens. "Hello Ms Itakisum, please come in". There was always a faux politeness when dealing with intelligence services. You never know what powers they come with, and thus where you might end up after the conversation. 

"Thank you Mrs Soum", Sana enters a modest and minimalist apartment. It was beautifully decorated. "Your apartment is lovely, just beautiful, makes me feel a bit shitty about my place upstairs". Mrs Soum smiles and gestures Sana to sit. 

"So you know why I’m here Mrs Soum, what can you tell me about your husbands state of mind a few days before he went missing? Anything out of the ordinary?" Sana asks whilst taking a seat on the sofa. 

"Well" Mrs Soum glances in the living room to see if her 2 children are eavesdropping. "He has seemed preoccupation for a few days now, not as attentive with me or the children. He said he had a lot of stress at work, especially with the recent series of blackouts. But we’d had worse situations before and it didn’t seem to affect him anywhere near as much".

"Do you know why your husband may have visited the waste disposal facility near the city walls?"

Mrs Soum looked confused. "Not at all... why do you ask? When did he visit there?"

"The day of his disappearance, he made a de-tour on his way the the border".

Mrs Soum’s face grew dark. She had not been told that the Doctor had gone through the border. Crossing state lines was only permissible with the correct permit. Which was almost impossible to come-by. And trespassing past the border without a permit was a capitol crime. 

"Are you saying that he" she paused "left the state?"

"Yes, were you not aware?"

"No, not at all, there’s no reason to it. Oh please help find him. Please".

Sana remained an hour or so to console Mrs Soum, but retrieved no useful information. She returned to her apartment frustrated. What’s more as she entered virtual flies were buzzing around the kitchen sink and wash baskets. She’d not cleaned up for days and set these pests to remind her. "Urgh, that’s the last think I want to do". Unfortunately virtual flies are more persistent than their long extinct brethren. So Sana had no choice. She had to do chores before crashing out with a glass of whiskey. 

Sana wakes in the middle of the night. Paolo her holodog was a bit buggy. Some nights it would go into guard mode and start barking at the window. Tonight was one of those nights. "Akata, silence the dog with a treat". 

"You have 125 tokens left". 

Sana shoves her head in her pillow and tried to nod back off. 

6am. The routine starts again. Sana retracts the bed, grabs a shower, throws on some clothes and makes her way down to street level, as she leaves she notices some officials entering the building. Probably here to ask Mrs Soum some more questions. She knows better than to ask any details and all surveillance of them will be either censored or restricted. 

Jumping in her car she pulls out her screen to continue scrolling through the last few hours of data before he went missing. 

Akata: "You have an incoming call from The Bureau".

"Accept"

"Ms Itakisum, we’re calling to inform you that we’ve found Dr Soum’s body yesterday, he was mistakenly shot by guard drones attempting to re-enter the state".

Sana was quiet, a mixture of disbelief, sorrow and shock. 

"Ms Itakisum?"

"Yes, sorry, thanks for letting me know".

Sana arrives at the Ministry building. She jumps out and makes her way in. Dashing up to the 22nd floor she makes her way to Kirosan’s office. As she approaches she can tell he has already had the news. 

"Kirosan sir. Any more details on what happened?"

"No Sana, just that a middle aged man attempted to gain unauthorised access to the state from outside the border and was shot in the process. The body was later identified as Dr Soum from his implant".

"How does someone successfully get out of the state without detection, and winds up getting shot trying to make their way back in? When getting out is a lot harder than getting in. I assume I’m still on the case sir?"

"Yes of course".

Sana bows and leaves Kirosan’s office. 

At her desk Sana is trawling through the data she has of Dr Soum, a few hours before he bolted and went to the waste plant to the west of the city. After hours of searching she’s starting to get bored and restless. Checking the time she realises that it’s been 10 hours, she’s sat there for 10 hours trawling through this footage and come up blank. The only lead that ended up a dead end was when Dr Soum went from his office in the power ministry to a café 5km away. It made little sense but he had a coffee on his own and then headed back. And no footage of the café revealed anything unusual or suspect. 

Sana called it a day and made her way to a bar around the corner from the office. 

She grabs a bear and sees a couple of colleagues at a table. This place is a regular to Interior Ministry folks. 

After being derided for being Kirosan’s favourite, and hitting back with some sub par banter, Sana gets Akata to get her home. 

At her apartment complex Sana decided to walk past apartment 3. Not really expecting to see or hear anything of note, but as she approached it was clear that something had happened. The door was wide open, the place looked trashed. Sana stepped in, it looked burgled, emptied of almost everything other than furniture. 

"Akata, what happened here?"

"The Soum’s have been detained by The Bureau, all personal possessions confiscated". 

"God damn!"

I need to get to the bottom of this. Tomorrow I’ll head out to that waste plant in person. 

No malfunctioning holopet dog this time, so a sound night. "Akata, get me a ride to the waste plant west of the city". 

"5 minutes".

Sana just downs her coffee before walking down the the street. She passes the Soum’s apartment on the way. No change. 

In the car on her way to the plant she has her morning calls, and then a 1:1 with Kirosan. 

"The plant will be completely automated you know Sana. Your job is at a desk, not in the field. Ideally you’d submit a request with The Bureau to send some goons out there for a physical inspection".

"I know, I’m just hoping that there’s a server at the plant to collate and relay the video feeds. Maybe it’s connection is dodgy or something. Worth a quick look isn’t it Sir?"

"Hmm. Well it’ll do no harm I’m sure. Just be careful, the bots there aren’t really programmed to avoid humans. Old tech to do simple jobs Sana".

When she arrives Sana pays to keep the car there for an hour. Shouldn’t take much longer than that to checkout the on-site servers. 

The waste plant is vast, dark, and motionless. No hubbub of the city, not people, just a bunch of robots moving large containers of waste either into recycling machines, de-atomisers or incinerators. 

There was a narrow walkway to a door dimly lit. Either side of the walkway were huge trenches. Hundreds of meters deep and full of containers. Large lifters were sorting them. The scale made Sana feel tiny and insignificant. The majority of this waste was going to be incinerated, it’s not that it couldn’t be recycled on the molecular level, more that the site manager couldn’t really be bothered to ensure efficient re-use. Easier just to burn it all. 

She made her way to the door. "Akata, is there anyone here?".

"No"

"Ok request access please. Forward it to Kirosan too".

"I’ll let you know once I get a reply"

Sana checked her screen while she waited. She was expecting some updated chitchat between a group of online friends. Or some news worth reading. But her none committal to break the boredom led to nothing more than her clicking and tapping around aimlessly. 

A few minutes later the door unlocked, as Akata informs her that she has been granted full access. 

Through the door was a long concrete lined corridor. She couldn’t really see the end but it looked to be about a kilometre long. She sighs and starts to walk down. 

"Akata, can you locate the server room?"

"You will need to load a map from the central control room at the end of this corridor. No other records of this facility can be found in official databases"

This wasn’t unusual, most state owned databases were incomplete. 

After 15 minutes of power walking, Sana reaches the end of the corridor. There’s one door labelled Central Control Room, it opens as she nears it. Inside is a dusty room with banks of flashing monitors, controls and a large screen with the status of every bot in the plant. 

From the looks of it none had malfunctioned beyond self repair and were humming away nicely. "Akata, which terminal will hold the mapping information you require?"

"Any should do Sana"

She jumps onto a nearby machine. Dusts off the display and looks for the implant jack. A standard connection that slips into your arm to interface with the implant. After a few minutes Akata has found the map and Sana is disconnected.

She notices in the corner of her eye a flashing. Looking up one of the status lights is flashing away red. A container mover is malfunctioning it seems. Ah well. Definitely not Sana’s problem. 

"Akata, server room?"

"The door to your left"

Sana swings round and sees a large green, dusty door with an unreadable plaque. As she nears the door opens in a plume of dust. Inside is a vast room, with aisle after aisle of server racks. 

She looks around for some sign of a control terminal. At the end of an aisle she spots a fold out display, she grabs her screen and syncs it. 

Tapping away she finds the surveillance sub system, she can see the video file cache. "Great, I just need to download it onto my screen and then I can GTFO". 

A spark fuzzes at the end of the row. She leaves her screen downloading and heads over. Lights illuminate in front of her as she goes. Finally she sees the source of the sparks. A severed data cable, probably an external access network, which would explain the lack of video data. "Akata, send a message to The Bureau to investigate this".

She walks back to her machine, on her way back she thinks she sees movement. 

Sana freezes. Her heart rate jumps. She whispers. "Akata, am I alone?"

The lights appear to flicker. Akata takes a moment to respond. It’s the longest moment she’s waited in a while. 

"Yes Sana. We are alone here".

A sigh of relief. Sana grabs her screen and returns to the control room. 

### Chapter 6

"Good morning Dr. How do you feel today?"

Dr Soum felt good, almost normal. 

"Is it over? Is it done?"

"Not quite Dr. It seems we’ve hit a snag. You’ll need to go under again. And soon"

Dr Soum began to weep. The pain was excruciating. 

### Chapter 7

Sana was already in the car and on her way back when she realised, out of irrational fear, that she’d not verified the download. 

She got distracted ordering another car, as her hour must have lapsed with the first one. 

Grabbing her screen she poked at the last actions. "Ok cool. Looks like I got a lot of it. Hopefully it’ll shed some light when I’m back at my desk... there’s a reason I didn’t qualify for field work".

"Kirosan calling"

"Answer. Good afternoon sir, everything ok?"

"I was about to ask you that"

"Yes everything is fine with me sir. I’m just on my way back to the office".

"Well, it’s been 2 days and you’ve not reported in Sana".

Sana hesitated for a minute. "What do you mean? I’ve been at the waste plant for a few hours this morning, and now I’m on my way back".

"...Sana, that message was sent 2 days ago, after which we heard nothing. Your implant went dark. We were just mobilising The Bureau this morning".

"What?!... But... I was just there for a few hours... I..."

"Maybe you should take a couple days leave and come back next week refreshed. Either way I’m happy you’re ok, I’m going to have to go and cancel the missing persons requests. Please consider the leave and get some R&R".

Kirosan ends the call. 

"Two days? Two. Days?!" 

Sana was completely confused and in disbelief. It just didn’t make sense. How was she out for two days? She pulls up her screen and starts searching for her location history, sure enough, she was at the plant for 2 friggin days! What the actual fuck?! 

Sana arrives home, she sits at her dining table, a bowl of ramen going cold as she pours over hours of surveillance footage of the waste plant. 

Although she was sure that the download from the servers showed the time range Dr Soum visited. She couldn’t see any evidence of him actually being there. There’s just hours and hours of robots milling about. The rhythm is mesmerising, but unfortunately elucidates nothing for her. 

Tampering with the implant was illegal, it was connected to state controlled servers, and the data is often used in many court cases. It was Sana’s primary source of information when researching, falling back on CCTV to try and help visualise scenes. However in some circumstances the Interior Ministry can request for 3D reconstructions of scenes, using all known data of the detected implants in the area. 

In Dr Soum’s case, he didn’t seem to interact with any implants that were out of his routine. Sana was giving up for the evening, she’d spent all evening searching through implant and surveillance data around the waste plant. The implant data confirms he stopped off there for a few moments before carrying on to the border where he went dark. 

For obvious reasons implant tracking stopped at the border. Although the Tokonoyan government have tried to launch satellites that can track citizens past the border, they have all been subverted. The city state, in what was old Japan, build a huge border wall around itself to protect citizens from another war. They’ve had peace now for centuries. The people of Tokonoya don’t even think about the wars of old in their days to day lives, or even their old enemies. 

However border expansion is mentioned, as the population grows and grows, but they found other ways to solve that problem. Namely shrinking the size of dwellings and building vertical layers in the city. The higher up you are, the wealthier you are. 

What this results in is a very concentrated set of implant data, and literally no data outside of the walls. So when someone was crazy enough to go through the border, they went dark. But I made implants entering Tokonoya super easy to discover, a general alert was sent to a handful of government ministries the second that event occurred. 

However, that event won’t occur for Dr Soum, thought Sana. As his body has already been found. Her face scrunched up as she frowned. 

"Wait wait wait" she said aloud. 

"Akata, where is Dr Soum’s body?"

"At The Bureau mortuary"

"Get me a car, I want to go there please"

Sana checks herself in the mirror and dashed out with her screen. 

### Chapter 8

"Doctor?"

"Doctor?"

"It’s done. It was successful. Can you open your eyes?"

Dr Soum begins to wake. "Yes, yes I think I can"

"It’s done you say? No more procedures?"

"Correct sir. We’re done. Once we have you healing we’ll let you go"

### Chapter 9

Sana arrived at the morgue, it was late and the lights were off. It was in the basement of a government building right in the centre of the city. Most citizens don’t even know it’s there. 

She walked through the steel door, reception was empty, but she worked her way into the building until she saw a mortician. Daniel was working away quietly removing organs from a deceased Tokonoyan. 

Sana approaches "Good evening, I’m with the Interior Ministry, I’m looking for a body brought in yester... a few days ago. Dr Soum".

"Dr Soum" he said, inquisitively "ah yes, the border shooting. This way" and he hurried down a corridor. After a few twists and turns they end up in an autopsy room. "Here he is"

"Thanks, if you have a moment I’d like to ask you some questions about him?"

"Sure, my works not going anywhere fast"

"First off, was there anything unusual discovered during the autopsy?"

"Not really, I mean The Bureau watched every step of the way but otherwise it seemed clear cut. Poor chap was shot twice in the chest and once in the neck trying to enter Tokonoya"

"His implant, has it been extracted?"

"Yes, of course. It’s plugged in over there" he points to a terminal at a large desk just a few meters away. "But you can’t take it. That’s one thing The Bureau made clear, once we’ve used it to confirm identity they the want us to pass it over to them. 

The implants were cryptographically encrypted, the private key was the hosts heartbeat. This was to ensure only your implant could be used in you. There was speculation that they were build with a government backdoor, but it seems in this case the private key is needed. As such Daniel was going to have to remove the heart and place it in a stimulator, which mimicked the last few beats of the owner based off muscle memory held in the organ itself. It was an extremely delicate procedure which had to be performed no more than a few days after death, otherwise the heartbeat wouldn’t be a close enough match and the implant would stay locked. 

"I could really do with knowing Dr Soum’s whereabouts a few nights before died, as well as Brain Image Recordings"

"The BIR’s are for Bureau eyes only I’m afraid. However the other stuff is no problem. Let me try and get this thing unlocked"

Daniel places the heart in a glass cylinder with full of fluids and flanked by electrodes. After a few seconds the heart began to beat erratically. 

"We have to wait now. Hopefully we’ll trigger a response that’ll unlock the implant, it could take a few minutes or hours"

"Hmm ok. Can you tell me, is there anything peculiar about Dr Soum’s injuries, or anatomy in any way. Can you see evidence of any struggles, bindings or anything on his person that may relate to a waste management plant?"

"Ok wow, that’s a lot of questions... and I’m not sure I have time to go through them all with you, unless..." Daniel tapped his screen.

Sana knew what this meant, he wanted bribing. It was common throughout Tokonoya, especially within state ran facilities. Bribery was rife in the Interior Ministry for example. 

"Sure, you have a holopet?"

"Oh yes, Buster, my pet Owl, he’s the best!"

"How would buster like 400 extra tokens?"

"Hmm, he’d like them enough to answer your first 2 questions. No and no. There, now let me get back to my job. I’ll contact you once his Implant is unlocked"

### Chapter 10

Dr Soum was finally walking around the facility. It’d been a few days since he arrived and apparently his progress was _astonishing_. He was just happy to not be plugged in and going under again. The first day after the procedure was the hardest, but since then things have got easier. So much so that he was ready to leave. 

He checked with Zhou, who performed the majority of the procedure on him and was the head of this cell, when he was able to leave?

"We have your escort almost ready Dr, you should be able to leave tomorrow, are you sure you want to go back to Tokonoya? After all this effort it seems somewhat pointless?"

Dr Soum just smiled at Zhou, "tomorrow then".

### Chapter 11

It was a few hours later when Daniel wheeled over to Sana who was faffing with her screen. "It’s done, the implant is decrypted"

"Great, let me interface with it?"

"Sure. There’s a port on the reader, you should be able to remote to it from your screen"

Sana connected to the implant. Immediately she could see the BID data firewalled. No way of seeing that without being fired, or worse. She starts pouring over the location data. She already knew his movement inside Tokonoya, but she was interested in whether any data could be gleaned from the implant about his movements outside the walls. 

She could tell that he travelled about 15 miles outside the walls. That’s not far enough to get to any civilisation she’s aware of. He then stayed stationary for four days before making his way back. 

As all implant data within Tokonoya is streamed to the Interior Ministry, this was the only useful information she had. 

One thing to note was that during his stay outside the walls, the implant data seemed scrambled. There were entire blocks of zeros where sections of data recoding were completely empty. "Very interesting" thought Sana. 

"Thanks for your help. I’m not sure there’s much more I can get from it now"

"No worries, thanks for the tokens!"

Sana leaves the morgue. 

"Akata, put in a request with The Bureau for Dr Soum’s BID data"

Akata made a confirmatory tone. 

### Chapter 12

Dr Soum was handed a pack by Zhou. 

"This should have enough supplies to get back to the wall, I have your escort ready. Are you ready to move out?"

Few people lived in the wastes between the cities. It was a nomadic lifestyle. Lawless but peaceful. Many who lived outside city walls did so because they were either wanted, or engaged in activities deemed illegal by the city states. 

Some communities existed, and trade was healthy, but the majority of the land was taken up with centuries old buildings. Left empty after the wars and walls. 

Dr Soum was with an underground group of smugglers and cyberpunks. His tokens were no use out here, so he had to trade something else. 

He’d contacted the group via a connect in work. A few people had left Tokonoya before the authorities got hold of them. It wasn’t hard to get in touch with Zhou’s group. But all communication had to go over the wall physically, or via one of the underground hacked data lines. Physical was best though. 

This is how Soum began his negotiations with Zhou, he was a high ranking engineer for the power department, the one thing he had worth trading for this huge and dangerous effort was knowledge. Zhou was undergoing some large engineering projects, mainly trying to build a hydro plant to supply energy to the community he was building. The trade seemed fair, Soum would clearly document how to repair and install the generators scavenged from nearby plants into the damn already build by Zhou’s people. 

Luckily for Soum the generators were in good condition, so just a few wiring diagrams were needed and his debt was paid. 

Now he was about to embark on the most dangerous part of his journey. Returning to Tokonoya. He was with a party of 6; including his escort, Zhou and 4 armed guards. 

Even though there was peace between the groups outside the walls, they could never be sure that either opportunists or worse, patrols from the city states wouldn’t run into them. 

They were packing an armoured vehicle, which was undergoing some last minute configuration by a tech. They regularly cycled the radio channels and stealth settings. The vehicle was as much a driving super computer as an armoured personnel vehicle. 

Zhou was already in the passenger seat with one of the guards driving, he leaned out he window to talk to Dr Soum. "So we’ll drive about 20 miles to a known dark zone. From there we’ll continue on foot for the last 5 miles. We can discuss the specifics en-route. Jump in the back and get buckled up, I’d like to move out soon"

Soum wandered to the back of the truck whilst watching a hustle and bustle of people working on all sorts of vehicles, things he’d never seen before. All of which looked far more advanced than anything in Tokonoya. It amazed him that even without the capital and commerce of a city state, these people were able to live and trade. 3D printing had solved many of the supply chain issues, but raw materials were still required, and formed a large part of the trade out in the wastes. 

He jumped into the back of the APV and buckled up. After about 10 minutes of rumbling along in silence, Zhou spoke up. "So, the plan is to split up once we’re a mile or so away from the wall. I’ll go with the decoy team and Hoya here will lead your team", Zhou patted the drivers shoulder. 

In the back of the APV sat Soum, his escort or decoy as Zhou called him, and three guards. They were engaged in light banter between them. Although armed to the teeth and clearly highly skilled they seemed somewhat gentle in their demeanour. Soum smiles at one of them politely, and he immediately engaged in some small talk. 

The conversation developed into talking about the need for trained guards out in the wastes. 

One of the guards began to elaborate past the non-answers given by his colleague. "It’s the city states. Especially Tokonoya, but Fintola too. They can’t stand us living out here, infiltrating their networks and helping people" he was suddenly cut off by Zhou who glared at him. 

"Dr Soum, we have a clear agreement, and we shall uphold our end to our best. But please don’t ask too many questions about our dealings with the city states"

An awkward silence fell for the remainder of the journey. 

### Chapter 13

Sana’s forced leave was over, but she’s not stopped working on the case of Dr Soum. Every turn just seemed to lead to more questions and no answers. It was a maddening state of affairs. Her holoflies had multiplied as she spent more and more time mapping out Dr Soum’s movements and investigating all human contact he had over the course of the weeks before his disappearance. 

She was in the car on her way in, following some spurious connection between the bagel stand Dr Soum used, and a smuggling network outside the walls; but it was leading nowhere. 

The car pulled up at her office and she hopped out. Just before she made it into the building she was stopped by someone.

"Hi, is it Sana?"

"Yes."

The question was redundant as Akata will have told him exactly who Sana was. 

"How can I help?"

"I work for the electricity board, I was a friend of Dr Soum. I believe you’re investigating his disappearance?"

"Yes that’s right... how did you know?"

"I have friends in The Bureau. They gave me your name... I have some information that may be of use to you. Is there somewhere private we can talk?

The man in front of Sana was about 1.8 meters tall, wore a short coat with a white T-shirt and combat pants. He had a rucksack on and a screen in his hand. His tone was extremely polite and he seemed harmless enough. 

"Sure, down here"

Sana walked down an alley next to the ministry building. She stepped into a doorway. 

Suddenly the man grabbed Sana by the arm. "You‘be got to stop looking for Dr Soum. Please. He’s gone and there’s nothing we can do to bring him back. But looking for him is putting me and my friends in great danger. Please!"

### Chapter 14

The APV slowed silently to a halt. Zhou started punching away at his screen. A few minutes later he turned to the passengers. "The vehicle will stay here, it’s stealth tech will keep it hidden from Tokonoya’s drones and it can scan the skies and keep us informed of their whereabouts"

Soum was amazed at the sophistication of the tech out in the wastes. He’d often assumed, and been told that those who lived outside of Tokonoya were lawless savages. It turned out that the wastes were full of Free People, trading, manufacturing and living lives in comfort and peace. Soum started to see why there’s so many Tokonoyans leaving the city. It seemed mad at first to him, but now he sees what life it like, it can understand it. 

He grabs his pack and looks to Hoya, he nods and starts to move out. Zhou extends his hand to Soum, "thanks Soum and good luck. Don’t worry we’ll get you back out when you need it".

"Thanks Zhou, until we meet again".

Soum chases after Hoya, with the other guard bringing up the rear. They marched in silence for 20 minutes or so when Hoya’s wrist screen started alerting him to a nearby drone. He fell to the floor and looked back at his squad, Soum wasn’t far behind on the ground as was Frile. Hoya crawls back to them, "it’s going in Soum’s direction. He should be near the wall by now".

Just as Hoya finished the sound of gunfire echoed through the valley. After a few seconds it stopped. He checked his wrist screen and his face grew dark, "we should move out as quickly as we can"

"What’s happened?!" Soum urged. 

Hoya didn’t answer, which was answer enough for Soum. They were just a few hundred meters away from the wall, Soum could see a small concrete structure with a steel door. Hoya was running towards it, he opens the door and they all file in. 

Hoya closes and locks the door. "This tunnel is a maintenance tunnel from centuries ago, it’s hardly used now but it’s still routinely checked by drones to try and stop anyone leaving Tokonoya. Keep close Dr, this is the last, and most dangerous stretch of our journey". 

"I’m exhausted, is there no chance of a few minutes rest?"

"Sure, I’d feel more comfortable doing it a bit further up where we have multiple egress points". 

They walked a few minutes until there was a fork in the tunnel. The group sat and took their packs off. Soum grabbed his water bottle and took some deep gulps, it tasted sweet and cool. He reflected on his journey so far, "I hope to god it’s all worth it!"

"You and me both!" Hoya said with a tone of frustration and stress. 

After a few minutes of rest and replenishment, Hoya puts his pack on and starts to make his way down the left fork. Soum and Frile followed him down a long disused tunnel; there were clear signs of decay all around, the concrete was cracking and loose. 

"What are these used for?" asked Soum

"The tunnels were part of the architectural inspection routes for the walls. When they were first build centuries ago they were a feat of engineering, now they seem simple, these tunnels were used to inspect their foundations, most have been sealed but we discovered a few which were only partially sealed, after a lot of work we managed to get them open and have used them for smuggling ever since. Tokonoya state are aware that they’re open, but rarely do drones or police venture down here".

They walk in silence for a few more minutes. 

"We’re close to the exit, it should return  you to the outskirts of the city. Your absence will have been noticed by the Interior Ministry. I suggest you go to our contact, Meeral, she’ll be able to hack their net and tell you whose leading the investigation and what they have on you so far".

"Thank you for everything Hoya, and thank Zhou for me too, if you can". 

Hoya nodded and they walked the last few minutes in silence again. 

The team arrived at a sealed steel door, Hoya unlocks it and it opens into a derelict warehouse. Soum looks around and sees no signs of life, or worse drone patrols. He leaves the tunnel and looks back at Hoya, who nods acknowledgment before closing the door and sealing it from the inside. 

### Chapter 15

Before she realised what was happening the stranger let go of Sana and rushed off. She gave chase. 

"Akata, contact local squaddies, co-ordinate his position with them and find a route to trap him in"

Sana was gaining ok him slowly as he darted between streets and ran around people. He dived into an apartment complex and started to make his way up. She followed him, Akata altered her "the local enforcers are surrounding the base of the building. A handful are following you up here"

She could see the man a few flights above her, she pressed harder to try and catch up with him. She was just a few feet away when she tripped. Or more importantly, was tripped. The stranger turned and grabbed her, everything went dark. 

"Akata emergency protocol!"

...

"Akata!"

... 

Sana tried to talk, but no words left her mouth. 

### Chapter 16

Soum looks at a piece of paper Hoya gave him with Meera’s address scribbled on it. She was in the Shinbata district, a poor area on the outskirts of Tokonoya. At least he wouldn’t need to go through the city centre to get to her. 

He leaves the warehouse to try and get his bearings. As he exits he realises he’s in a similarly poor neighbouring district to Shinbata. Tokonoya Central is clean and wealthy, but the majority of the surrounding districts are poverty stricken and neglected. Wealth was centralised under decades of reckless monetary policy, at first people kept voting for more and more spending and welfare policies but when nothing changed they gave up, resorting to either the black market or other nefarious and illicit trade to try and make ends meet. 

Soum navigates the intricate backstreets of shops and apartments until he gets to the address listed. It’s a hodgepodge of holovendors, peddling everything from flies to sexholos. One of these neon lit vendors matches the address.

"I’m looking for Meera?"

The shop assistant looked him up and down. 

"How do you know her?"

"I was sent here by Zhou" Soum didn’t really know what else to say. He hadn’t really prepared for much of his return to Tokonoya. 

"She’s in the basement. Follow me"

Soum follows the assistant to a hatch in the floor, she opened it and walked Dow the stairs. 

I’m the basement was a large frosted glass cube.

"It’s a quiet room, no radio signals in or out. Akata will be useless in there". 

She gestured to the doorway. Soum nodded and walked in. 

Inside was a middle aged woman, she had short black hair and was dressed in a black T-shirt and black combat pants. She had a prosthetic arm which was connected to a terminal. 

"Soum I presume? Zhou told me to expect you. You’re after info on the investigation into your disappearance?"

"Yeah, I need to know if it’s safe for me to return to my family"

"Well, I’ll tell you what I’ve hacked. The Interior Ministry are looking into your disappearance. It’s a high priority investigation but they’ve not got far. Agent Sana is heading up the analyst team it seems. I’ll upload her implant ID into yours so you can track her. I trust you no longer have the Akata implant?"

"No, I have the FP version".

"Great, come over here and let me give you her details"

Soum walks over to her desk hesitantly. Meera pulls out a scanner and waves it over his neck. A green light flashes in Soum’s vision. He hears a voice ask him, "do you wish to accept the data upload from ID#3464247 aka Meera?"

"Er.. yes"

There was a pulsing yellow light and then back to green. 

"All sorted then Soum, the investigation’s only just begun. I’ve seen that there’s a trace of you stealing data from the waste plant in the suburbs, Sana hasn’t retrieved that yet so you should probably get ahead of it. Your FP implant is a huge upgrade on Akata, but I assume you already know that, otherwise why would you of risked everything to get it"

"Thank you Meera, what can I do to pay you back?"

"Keep fighting Soum. Don’t let them win"

Soum nods and leaves. He makes his way to a noodle bar nearby to contemplate his next move. He’s gotta find his family but he can’t do that if the authorities are still looking for him. 

### Chapter 17

Sana wakes up like a bulb being turned on. It’s not that she was asleep or knocked out, she just wasn’t and now is. Light comes rushing into her vision as she’s blinded by the daylight. After a few seconds shapes start to become more defined. 

"Sana. I’m sorry about this"

Sana tries to get up but can’t. She tries to move her hand to shield her eyes but can’t. She can’t move at all. Panic begins to set in, her heart rate quickens, fight or flight kicks in but all she feed is the immense frustration of being trapped. 

"I really need you to stop looking for me, I can’t think of what else to do, every option leads to you just going back to work trying to hunt me down"

"S... Soum?"

Sana shuck her head. "Of course not. Soum’s dead. You must be from my last investigation. Which makes you Yojimata, the gang leader. But we caught you and put you away, did you escape?"

"Sana, before I proceed let me explain something to you"

### Chapter 18

Soum finished his noodles. His new implant could read his thoughts, it was secured and totally private, impossible to hack without a direct link and direct approval from him. All he had to do was think about Sana, and all the data stored on his implant came streaming in. Meera has said she’d not found the traces at the waste plant yet, but he couldn’t leave it to chance. 

The waste plant was 50km away, so he’d have to risk a taxi. Luckily there was a screen in his pack so he at least would have Akata transferable tokens to pay for a cab, he grabbed the screen out of his bag and ordered his ride. 

A few minutes later his taxi appeared. He jumped in and assigned his account on his screen. If he’d still had Akata this would have all been automated but seeing as he’d gone FP its now a little bit more laborious. 

After an hour or so Soum arrived at the waste plant. He’d used the time to get to know his new implant a bit better. This think was phenomenal, so powerful it almost scared him. He was however reassured that basically everyone in the wastes had one, so at least it wasn’t dangerous.  

He got out of his ride and it wizzed off. Looking at the waste plant a chill went down his spine. 

"Let’s make this quick, get in, erase the traces and get out"

He was at this plant a few short days ago, stealing AI tech for trade with Zhou. Although his mind was the real value, part of the deal was AI tech found in the auto cleaners and other bots in the plant. Is seems like he’d left a digital fingerprint that he needed to erase before Sana decided to investigate it further. 

Soum makes his way to the control room, then he opens the large green door to the server room. He closes it behind him. Last time he was here was when he stole the AI data, for that he had to disable to CCTV manually by literally cutting the cable to that particular server. 

Now he’s here to make sure that he finishes the job. He jacks into a terminal with his screen and starts searching for caches, after a few minutes he’s found the video cache, file access cache and connection cache. Just as he’s starting to erase it Soum hears a noise in the control room. 

It’s Sana. His implant is streaming data about her right into view.

"Fuck", Soum’s hides as best he can. 

After a few minutes the door to the server room opens. Soum starts to panic. He sees Sana connecting her screen to a terminal. 

"Fuck fuck fuck. I’ve not erased the cache yet. There’s nothing for it. I’ll have to get her screen off her"

He sees Sana wandering from the terminal to the cut cable. 

"Now’s my chance"

Soum rushes towards her as quietly as he can, once he’s in range he commands his implant to black her out. 

Sana collapses on the floor in front of him. 

Soum gets to her screen and begins wiping the cache. He also clears it all from the servers, a quick double check and he goes and sets Sana’s implant to wake in 48 hours. 

"Hopefully that’s enough to ruin any chance of an investigation"

### Chapter 19

Soum looks in the mirror. This face still took some getting used to, but then it’s only been a couple days. He’s taller too, the new perspective was disorienting. His host was young and well build, but he felt older than ever, Zhou had found him a superb body, but the mental leap from his old self to this new one was always going to be hard. He had been warned not to think about it too much, just let it be and the mind will adjust eventually. 

"Sana, I am Soum"

The words were harder to say than he expected. 

Sana sat in utter confusion. How could the person in front of her claim to be Soum. Was the heartbeat analysis somehow spoofed? Seem implausible but perhaps possible. I mean he clearly has some advanced tech that allows him to hijack her Implant and use it to disable her. That much she’d figured out in the few minutes she’d regained consciousness. 

"If you’re Soum. Who’s body turned up in the morgue last week?"

"That was the old me. This is the new, or should I say, current me".

This was too much for Sana to process. Was this man in-front of her suggesting that he in fact _is_ Soum, as was the body shot outside the wall. How can that be?!

"I see you’re confused Sana, expectedly, let me explain. The Implant is more than a convenience, you use it as an integrated personal computer. Pay bills, organise your life, connect to the Tokonoya net, but what you don’t know about is it’s deeper integrations. It’s cognitive integration. Akata is more than a personal AI". 

Soum begins to explain his discovery whilst working at the electrical facility. 

He was researching how to better integrate Akata into the power stations control system. 

"Jinsan, did you compile a new kernel version with the Akata hooks in it?"

"No Dr, I’ve hardly touched that part of the code base for months".

"Hmm, strange because there are traces of Akata here. Let me dig some more"

Soum spent the next two days unfurling and hacking into the control system. After which the real purpose of Akata became clear. It was a decentralised artificial intelligence that controlled all Tokonoya. 

The discovery terrified him because something else became clear, Jinsan _had_ compiled a new kernel. The electrical facility had a hardline into the Interior Ministry and The Bureau who were working with Akata to not only control all of Tokonoya, but via The Implants also control Toyonoyans. 

"It’s why I had to disable your Implant, to stop Akata from listening in, or worse gain control of you to stop me. I’m not some freedom fighter and I’m not after a revolution. I just want me and my family to be free of Akata and Tokonoya".

This was a lot for Sana to take in. She started to consider how integrated into her life Akata was, she didn’t even remember _when_ he was implanted. Life without Akata scared her and she recoiled, beginning to reject his ideas.

"You’d say anything wouldn’t you Soum. You’re nothing more than a cyber terrorist. An enemy of the state! You’ve got a hackable implant and now you’re here to wreak havoc and gain power!"

The rumour of an open source version of The Implant had existed for a while. Called the Free People’s Implant, Sana has heard how it might be able to integrate into the net and circumvent firewalls put in place by the Interior Ministry. She had discounted a lot of this as rumours and hearsay but now she knew it was real. How many of these terrorists were in Tokonoya? What was their ultimate goal? 

Either way her immediate predicament remained. She was being held hostage by Soum with no ability to control her actions. Sana suppressed the raising emotions of the consequences that led to. Instead she focused on what _was_ in her control. 

"Explain how the heartbeat analysis identified the body in the morgue as Soum, and you claim to be Soum too!"

Soum takes a deep breath. 

"After contacting the Free People to try and barter my escape, they told me they needed 2 things from me in return for my entire family to be freed from Akata and the Tokonoyan state. The first was some technical expertise in hydro-electricity but the second was much more intriguing. They asked me to retrieve some AI code from an auto-mech here in Tokonoya. They weren’t picky which type of mech but gave me some suggestions, one of which was the waste disposal mechs at the waste plant just outside the city."

"So, on my way to meet my liberators I made a stop at that plant and retrieved the source code for a few auto-mechs, as well as some of the learned procedures and data."

"Zhou was very pleased with it all actually." Soum showed signs of pride which wasn’t lost on Sana. 

"But how does that relate to what I asked?! Are you being deliberately obtuse!" Sana demanded.


### Chapter 20

Soum handed Zhou a small drive, murmuring "this is all I could grab with the time I had"

Zhou looked dubiously at the device. 

"Ok, let’s run this to Gerintek, she’s in the lab; follow me"

Zhou began walking through a smooth, brushed steel tunnel. Light oozed from beams in the wall. The environment was far from what he’d imagined, he’d been led to believe those who lived in the wastes lived in destitute poverty. What he was actually presented with was a beautiful clean underground network of affluent communities working together to make a comfortable life away from the oppressive regimes of the city states. 

Zhou gestured towards an opening in one of the tunnels. He paused, "we need to make our way to Stath, Gerintek’s home commune. It’s a short ride on the VacRail. I’ll pay for your ticket, no Tokonoyan tokens are accepted here".

The pair walk onto a platform of sorts, there are numerous vacuum sealed tunnels with magnetic rail trains connecting the major communities. VacRail ran a handful of connections between the larger communes. 

Zhou and Soum hop in a cart as it makes its way to Stath. The train wasn’t all that full, but there was a comforting hustle and bustle, the interior was white and brushed metal, soft but clinical and clean. Like nothing Soum has seen before in the dank, poorly maintained public transport of Tokonoya. 

Soum marvelled at the superior technology of the Free People, all those years of being told about the wild, survivalist tendencies of those who actually chose to live outside the system, alone in the cold and desperate wilds between city states. The reality he was faced with was in stark contrast; most of the citizens still lived underground, a remnant of when the city states would openly attack the Free People as they saw them as a threat. 

This drove the Free People underground, to avoid areal targeting and assassination. THe byproduct was that the Free People developed an interconnected system of underground transportation methods arose. They took a few decades to interlink the communities but what emerged was truly awesome. There is no system of government in the wilds, the Free People are just that, entirely free, sure the local districts have certain rules and norms which people are free to follow. Most are living in the wilds to escape oppressive regimes and are thus similarly minded to reject the authoritarian approaches of the city states. 

Zhou could tell Soum was in awe, "We are certainly not without our problems, this isn’t utopia but we prefer it here than in any of the city states, especially Tokonoya". 

"Well it seems like utopia to me!"

"It would do through the lens of a Tokonoyan".

Soum thought on this whilst also marvelling at the speed and efficiency of the VacRail. Within a few minutes they had reached Stath. It was a smaller commune so it only had one VacRail stop. 

Soum and Zhou disembarked. They worked their way through a busy network of tunnels until they reach an open space roofed with a dome. Lights from shops and dwellings filled the space with an almost star field like twinkling. Soum noted that spiralling around the dome was a walkway, fronted by a mixture of stores or what looked like entrances to dwellings. It was truly a remarkable place. 

"Are all the communes this beautiful Zhou?"

"For the most part yes, but for those who want to live a more degenerate life, there are places for them too. They’re further out from here. Those like to keep themselves to themselves and not really bother with us."

Soum felt a rush of excitement, it was at this moment that he knew he was doing the right thing for his family. If they could live in a place like this, he knew they would be happy and safe.

"Come on Soum, no time to sightsee let’s hope Gerintek is still home and happy to read this for me". Zhou patted the pocket with the device Soum had brought. 


### Chapter 21

"Ahh, Tokonoyan tech, nice!" Gerintek wheeled her chair round her desk and grabbed a screen. She held it close to the device Soum brought and text began to scroll on her display. She studied it for a few moments and then put it down.

Her face drew dark and she took her glasses off and rubbed her eyes. An affectation which she often did under stress. 

"Do you know what this is Zhou?"

"No, my friend here has brought it as payment for his escape from Tokonoya. What did you get from it?"

"You" Gerintek turned to Soum, "Where did you get this?"

"I stole it from the servers at a waste facility on the outskirts of Tokonoya".

"You know about Akata I take it?"

Soum hesitated, "It’s why I need to get my family out of Tokonoya. As soon as possible!"

"Zhou" Gerintek stood to face him, "Akata has become Tokonoya; from this data I can already see that his AI is in control of many of the Tokonoyan’s via their implant. He is also in control of all of the transportation and public services. It seems like our worst fears have been confirmed".

Zhou rubbed his chin, "hmmm, are we sure Akata isn’t under the control of the Tokonoyan elite? Is he truly an AI free to do as he pleases?"

"That I do not yet know, but I can tell you this, regardless of _who_ controls him, _what_ they control is frightening me to my core. Soon the whole of Tokonoya will be enslaved by Akata. The citizens won’t realise it and worse, will feel like it is to their benefit but once they acquiesce to the implant, they become part of Akata".

"What’s more is that each implant becomes Akata, making him impossible to destroy. There is no central control point, each person, every device _is_ Akata".


### Chapter 22

"You can believe what you want Sana, but this is what happened, it’s likely that if enabled Akata will manipulate the hormones in your brain to further dispel these ideas. I would have reacted the same had I not seen Akata first hand and realised what he had become".

Sana remained in silent thought. 

"But how did you defeat the heart beat analysis? There’s more you’re not telling me Soum!"

"Correct, I would love to keep discussing this with you, but I need to find my family and the Tokonoyan security forces will be trying everything to locate you. I fear we may not have the time to discuss this more. Please Sana, allow me to find my family and leave Tokonoya, what harm is it to you if we do!"

"Tokonoya only works if we all stick together and work together to the one goal of a better Tokonoya. That is why we have laws in the first place, to protect our citizens and improve all our lives!"

"And that is great for you, but what if you don’t want to be a part of Tokonoya, what if you want to be free from Akata?"

Sana winced at the phrasing. She still rejected the idea of Akata holding some kind of control over her; but Soum’s point wasn’t without merit. If he wanted for some strange reason to live outside Tokonoya in the wilds, why not let him? It’s the danger he’s putting his family in that made her recoil from this line of reasoning. 

"No Soum, I won’t help you. I’m sorry; you can do what you like but dragging your family out there isn’t an option I’m willing to entertain".

Soum realised that his time, and patience had run out. He weighed his options. Sana was his best bet at finding his family, but he couldn’t in good conscience take her hostage. On the other hand if he re-enabled her implant he was confident that Akata would alert the authorities to her whereabouts. He hesitated for what felt like an eternity; really his best bet was to stick to his principles and let Sana go. It was impossible to begin any implant initialisation without first bringing Akata online, but there were some modifications he was able to do to her Akata, he closed his eyes and concentrated.

He could see she was beginning to get her sense of touch back, she struggled but slowly raised her hand and moved her fingers. 

"Sana, please, tell me where my family is".

She remained silent.

Realising the futility of his request, Soum turned and rushed out of the room. 

### Chapter 23
The door burst open, light and dust flooded the room. Sana squinted and shielded her face. Pushing herself up onto her knees she struggled to get up. Heavily armoured security force officers were pouring into the small concrete room, weapons held high shouting at Sana to remain still and place her hands on her head. 

She complied with their commands, "my name is Sana Yamada, I am a Senior Analyst for the Interior Ministry". A security officer walked over and scanned her implant, he turned to a colleague and nodded. 

"It’s her sir!" 

Kirostan entered the room, wearing a long coat and wide rimmed hat. "Well Sana, it seems we need a debrief".

Exhausted, Sana nodded at Kirostan. 

The armed men helped her to her feet and walked her to the waiting transports. Kirostan hung back to direct the forensic bots before following the squad. 

He sat himself next to Sana and sighed. 

"You have us quite the scare Sana. We were tracking your implant until, and how this happened we’re still unsure, your implant ceased transmission. What did Soum tell you? Have the terrorists in the wastes acquired some sort of blocking system? Have they cracked our signals encryption?"

Sana hesitated, she wasn’t sure how much she should divulge. Or whether Akata would know she was lying and would betray her to Kirostan. She needed time. 

"Sir, I am exhausted, can we debrief tomorrow?"

Kirostan looked Sana in the eye. "Of course Sana. First thing?"

Sana nodded and turned to look out the window. She could feel Kirostan’s gaze on her. 

Dr. Soum left the apartment complex, he could hear the sirens on the other side. He knew Sana wouldn’t willingly give up the location of his family, he’d fully intended to just extract the information  directly from her using his superior implant but after an initial scan he could tell that she didn’t know. 

He hurried down the busy side streets, towards Meera’s apartment. He needed her help again, this time to find a way of hacking into Akata and finding his family. Although decentralised there were nodes, mainframes which merged and backed up Akata’s data, much like the one at the waste plant. He would need to find one which contained the Interior Ministry sensitive data. 

### Chapter 24
Zhou makes his way to the gates of Tokonoya with his decoy Dr Soum. He knew what had to be done, and just how dangerous it was. It wasn’t far, he moved along a ridge, before him was a huge outer wall, at the base a small, derelict road that lead from Tokonoya to Fintola. Unused since the last drone war but still guarded by air patrols. Zhou held back, the decoy looked at him knowingly. 

"Head straight for the wall, stay low and keep under cover when you can".

The decoy immediately moved out, running crouched along the ridge before zig zagging across to the wall. He was a few meters away when a siren rung out. He froze, and turned upwards to look for impending death. A drone was already hovering over his position, before he could make a break for it he fell to the floor. His vision darkened. 

Zhou stayed hidden for another hour or so, before tracking back to meet the others at the APV. Hoya was already there, he greeted Zhou as he hopped into the ATV and began the trip back. Everyone was silent, but there was an air of joy; the loss felt as though it paled in comparison to the success of getting someone back into Tokonoya. 

### Chapter 25
Sana entered her apartment, she almost heaved as she walked past the Soum’s empty home. So much had happened since she was in there just a few days ago. 

The seed Soum had planted began to flourish into a thorned tree branching paths through her mind. 

Perhaps it was true. Or perhaps it was a lie designed to cripple her with doubts. Had Soum of not disabled her Akata then surely any suggestion of control would have just been white noise to her. But now the seed has been planted, could she really ignore the ramifications? 

Worse still and perhaps more persuasive, was the fact that she couldn’t actually switch Akata off. That fact had never troubled her until now, it just seemed a fact of life that all would receive the implant which would make every humans life it Tokonoya so much more efficient. 

But what if? What if! The questions just kept coming, so much so that Sana needed to take 5, make some tea and sit at her window watching the sun set over the busy Tokonoya. Try to find some inner peace and contemplate the situation rationally. 

She woke from a slumber on the couch, it was already late, getting up Sana decided to have a look around the Soum’s apartment, perhaps there was some clue she had missed before. Some sign as to their whereabouts and thus the whereabouts of Dr Soum. Sana had decided in her contemplation that even if Soum was right, there was very little she could do about it, especially with Akata still active in her implant. So she would continue her efforts to find him, and now she knew his supposed motives.

"Akata, what’s my calendar for tomorrow, erm, I mean today" she corrected herself after glancing at her watch and realising midnight had already passed. 

There was no response. 

"Akata"

Still no answer. She knew she had to debrief with Kirostan at some point in the morning but hadn’t received a notification from him as to the time. 

"Akata, when’s my debrief with Kirostan?"

No answer...

What now? She’d never considered what’s to do if Akata didn’t respond. There must be a ministry she could go to for repairs, diagnostics, something. But first, let’s get to work. She grabbed her screen, it was blank, "Damn!" She whispered to herself. The screen uses Akata to identify you and turn on. What now? She couldn’t even call a car to take her to work.  

"Nothing for it. I’ll have to walk". Again, muttering to herself. 

Sana leaves her block. It’s another dark and rainy day, lights of the city smudged and reflected off the street. It was fairly quiet so must have been early, she stopped at a street cart and ordered a nurocafe, a specialised caffeine shot which augments with Akata to allow 10% extra cognition. She bought it out of habit more than anything but secretly she hoped it would help her figure out what her next step should be. 

No Akata.

Could such a thing really happen. She’d never heard of anyone _not_ having Akata installed. Sure, some people has faulty modules which didn’t always run the latest software but no Akata at all. That was something new, something terrifying and yet, perhaps if only slightly, liberating. 

Sana decided that she needed to figure out whether Akata was gone for good or only temporarily disabled. But if she went through official protocol what would they do with her? Hopefully reinstall the implant and let her life return to normal. So she decided there was no real alternative, she has to talk to Kirostan. 

Without Akata it was going to be a long and lonely walk to the Ministry building, but there was no alternative. 

### Chapter 26
Soum ordered noodles from a bar next to Meera’s apartment, synthetic fish and printed udon. He sat quietly for a moment watching the busy street full of cars, the rain bouncing off the road and windows. Up until now synthetic fish tasted fine to him, neither especially good or bad, but since tasting real fish with Zhou, this synthetic alternative left much to be desired. However the nostalgia and habit calmed him.

He knew why his family had been taken, it was a risk when he began this journey. But a risk worth taking. It was likely that they had been moved "for their own safety" to a protected facility in anticipation of his return. Akata would have run the scenario and returned a probability of Soum returning, and as that was predictably high, the most sensible course of action was to move his family to a secured location.

However Soum had planned that once the Interior Ministry retrieved his original body, they’d release his family and he’d be able to extract them to join Zhou and the Free People. That hadn’t happened and after although revealing himself to Sana was a risk, Soum felt he was pressed for time and had little choice. 

He finished up his noodles and made his way up to Meera’s apartment. He knocked gently on the steel door, after some time a small hatch slid open and Meera’s eyes peered out. 

"What do you want?!"

She sounded agitated. Soum was concerned that if he misspoke he’d find himself without her help.

"I need your help Meera. My family is being held by the Interior Ministry and I have no way of finding them. The only thing I can think of is to hack a backup node to see where they’re being held"

Meera sighed. 

"There is a node, the other side of the city, you’ll have to gain physical access to it and like all backup nodes it’s watched 24/7. Although Tokonoya’s Interior Ministry is woefully inefficient the automated systems around these nodes are actually pretty decent". 

"You can use your implant to access the node with but you have to be near-by. Let me get you a screen with the coordinates".

The shutter slides closed. 

Soum waits patiently for a few minutes. His mind wanders to the logistics of crossing the city. He can use his implant to access public transport, but the risk of being flagged as _unusual_ or any way out of the ordinary was high. As soon as he was detected as abnormal in any way security forces would swoop in and take him for questioning. 

The shutter slides open again. 

"Here"

Meera hands him a screen. 

"You can use the screen or upload the coordinates to your implant".

"Thank you Meera..." Soum was stopped mid breath as Meera slides the shutter shut. 

"That’s that then I suppose" though Soum. 

He leaves the apartment complex staring at the screen Meera passed him. 

### Chapter 27
Zhou now knew, that a full cognitive transfer was possible with not only their implant, but the Tokonoyan implant too. 

The ATV rolled into the underground bunker which formed part of the central hub of the complex network of the Free People. As it reached Zhou’s head quarters it slowed to let the team out, before driving off to park itself. 

Zhou went directly to the underground train to make his way to Gerintek. She had been instrumental in transplanting Soum’s implant into the donated host. Although dark, the host had died naturally and Soum’s willingness to risk his life on such an experimental procedure offered an unprecedented opportunity. 

Gerintek had extracted the hosts implant shortly after he died. He was subsequently placed in cryo in anticipation of this procedure. The unknown was whether Gerintek and her team were able to transfer Soum into this host, and program a new consciousness for Soum’s body. All of this had been simulated multiple times, but a simulation versus reality was very different. 

"It was a success Gerintek, Soum’s body will have already been collected and there’s no doubt Tokonoyan authorities will identify it as him. You think we can refine the extraction process so we can store deceased implants for re-insertion at a later date?"

"The ramifications of this successful experiment are huge Zhou, we should see if we can restore a consciousness into none organic matter. I’ve been working on a model that will allow us to upload an implant into a screen, or even have multiple consciousnesses reside in a single implant".

Zhou was no engineer, nor a philosopher, some of these ideas had never occurred to him. He sat at a nearby stool deep in thought. 

"I think for now we should keep these developments to ourselves, I will talk to my team to ensure it goes not further. This is potentially dangerous information and we need to consider carefully whether we want to expose it".

"If we don’t, someone else will develop this tech".

Zhou thought over the options. The morality of this situation wasn’t clear to him.

"At least anyone who wants to, should be free to transfer their consciousness to their implant; and from there have it secured after they die. But we need to establish some rules before opening this up".

Zhou began to see a clear path on how this development can be used, voluntarily and safely. He began to let himself get excited about the prospects. Pseudo immortality. The goal of humanity for millennia was now finally within reach. 

"It’s been a long week Gerintek, thank you for all you’ve done here. We should talk about everything we’ve learned at the next shareholder meeting".

And with that Zhou made his way back to the train. Still deep in thought he sat alone whilst it quietly rushed towards his home. He hardly noticed that after a couple of stops, he was no longer sitting alone. To his right there was a young woman with an infant, the profoundness of the last few hours began to sink in. The sacrifice of Soum to lose is physical identity, not to mention the risk to his life, all to free his family from the shackles of Tokonoya. 

Zhou was on the brink, he needed to go home and sleep before he broke down under the enormity of Gerintek’s discovery. 

### Chapter 28
After some time and little stimulation Sana reached the ministry district. She had lingered at the border for a while wondering what would happen as she crosses the threshold without Akata. 

Most of Tokonoya is a mixture of living districts and manufacturing, mining and refinements. She’d managed to navigate through to the Ministry District without tripping any checkpoints, but entering without Akata would be impossible. 

En route she had been considering her options. If Soum was right, then as soon as she entered the district she’d be apprehended and likely incarcerated. She’d heard about lunatics who had tried to resist the Akata implant for their children, the were arrested and held in detention centres. At the time Sana thought it was perfectly reasonable, why on earth wouldn’t you want Akata, day to day life in Tokonoya would be impossible without it. So denying your children Akata was impoverishing them which is against the law. It was the states duty to do what is right for the children and remove the negative parental influence. 

Now however, her perspective had been altered. As an upstanding citizen she had no fear of being arrested, and although she didn’t voluntarily disable Akata, the question remains as the whether the authorities would believe her. Or if they’d even try to. 

The rain was falling hard. Almost as if it was being thrown down from above to accelerate it to be faster than gravity. And the weight of it was pushing Sana into the ground. The decision to cross this invisible line was much tougher than she originally thought. Her whole life she never questioned the state; why would she, it was there to protect ever citizen of Tokonoya. But with Akata gone, and the suggestion from Soum that Akata is an agent of the state to control, as opposed to aid, it’s citizens. Had bored it’s way into Sana’s mind, and now she was stuck. The physical border a manifestation of her internal struggle. 

The only way to know if Akata, or Soum is right, would be to cross the border and find Kirostan. 

She stepped over the threshold and walked quickly towards the Ministry building.  

### Chapter 29
"Togeshi, we’ve been alerted an anomaly, grab your gear and let’s go!"

"En route captain".

Togeshi walked down to the armoury to sign out his handgun. 

"Akata, sitrep". 

"Togeshi, TPK have been alerted to an anomaly crossing the border into the ministry district".

The Tokonoya Peace Keepers were a branch of the police who dealt with dissidents and ensured social cohesion. 

Togeshi signed for his weapon and left the precinct to get in the car Akata had waiting for him. He never knew the details of the operation, and frankly he didn’t care, if there were Tokonoyans disturbing the peace that was enough for him. 

The car was heading towards the border of the ministry zone. This was the most heavily patrolled area of Tokonoya. Drones, sensors and TPK regularly patrol the perimeter. The car slowed as Togeshi’s screen vibrates. 

Sana Itakisum - Age 34 - arrest on site. Considered dangerous. Avoid deadly force. Alerting bureau - Special Science Unit. 

Next to those details was a picture of Sana, but oddly no tracking information. Akata should be relaying her position to Togeshi. 

"Hmm"

Togeshi was very confused. 

"Gonna have to do it the old fashioned way, Akata, take me to the point at which Ms Itakisum entered the ministry district". 

The car sped along. 

Togeshi found the rain pummelled the roof of the car, the white noise began to make him feel tired. He stared out of the window, his eyes focused on a young woman as he sped along. 

### Chapter 30
Sana half expected sirens to ring out the second she crossed over into the district. Instead nothing obvious happened, and for several kilometres she marched in the rain, following a busy road to the Interior Ministry office. Sana tried her hardest not to look into the cars as they raced past. It was only a matter of time before the TPK would come for her. 

Every now and then she’d forget her predicament and look into a car, wishing she was warm and dry. 

One vehicle was flying past especially fast, she glanced in and caught the eye of the passenger. She smiled nervously but in a blink he was gone. 

She was only 10 minutes from the Interior Ministry, even though she was still conflicted, her decision was made and she was in autopilot. Like her body was marching whilst her mind was still grappling with the situation. 

Kirostan was in his office when his screen buzzed. He looked to see the lobby screen calling, he looked puzzled at the drenched Sana. 

"I’ll let you up now Sana"

Having gathered that there was no other reason for Sana to be in touch via the lobby screen. He was however, eager to get the details from her. After a few minutes Sana emerged from the stairs, as lift use also required Akata. 

"Sana. Tell me everything, and hurry because the TPK will likely be close behind".

Sana took a deep breath. She recounted events as accurately as she could remember, but when it got to explaining _why_ Dr Soum had fled in the first place, she omitted some details. 

"That is a lot to process".

"The outlaws in the wastes can move consciousness between implants, as well as disable implants of Tokonoyan’s. I can only imagine he has undertaken this entire exercise to gift himself that power". 

Kirostan said that last sentence to himself. 

Kirostans screen lit up, his focus snapped to it and his face grew dark. 

"The TPK are here Sana, I cannot stop them from taking you but I will do everything within my power to ensure you have a swift hearing with a positive outcome".

Sana’s heart rate spiked. Nerves build instantly, but before she had time to rationalise her pulse down four TPK officers stood at Kirostan’s door. 

She submitted to them, marching out of the Ministry building and into their transport. The TPK were silent, hardly acknowledging her at all, two sat opposite her and the other two either side. The transport, using a priority lane, sped towards a TPK facility deep in the Ministry Zone. 

Sana had managed to calm herself she knew she’d done nothing wrong and as long as that could be explained to the decision makers, all would be fine. 

The transport soon arrived at the TPK facility. 

### Chapter 31
Soum had to cross into The Ministry District. He knew that the heat sensors would detect him, then his implant would be scanned and Akata would request for access rights. Failing to establish these the authorities would swoop in. However he had a secret weapon that they hadn’t encountered before, his superior implant.  

He darted down some side streets, he had to almost jog through the district to get to the relay before the TPK tracked him, even though he didn’t have Akata they could use good old fashioned facial recognition, heat scans and heart rate monitors. Tokonoya was full of ways to track its citizens, many of these technologies had been made obsolete by Akata but most were still at least functional. 

Sure enough, Akata alerted the TPK of his movements, after approving a court order, which was all digital and merely a formality for Akata. Although the pretence of law and justice was still held in Tokonoyans’ consciousness, in reality the law was what Akata defined it. The normal process being that Akata was considered an objective, impartial arbiter and therefore could automatically grant arrest warrants via the Offices of Judges. In this instance Akata had granted a warrant for the arrest of Dr Soum, and had forwarded this warrant onto the TPK. 

Togeshi‘s screen lit up, Akata alerted him to the open warrant, "Togeshi, warrant TOK87638/f has been sighted en route through The Ministry District, heading and direction is available on your screen but exact location is intermittent, meet the arrest team in Vehicle Bravo. 

Togeshi was just debriefing after detaining the young operative, Ms Itakisum. He rushed the arrest success review and dashed down to the lot where Vehicle Bravo was waiting in a bay, most of the arrest team were already onboard with the exception of the arrest leader. Togeshi dropped himself on a free seat and went through the motions of ensuring his equipment was in order. 

Riku, the arrest lead jumped into his seat. 

"Akata, let’s go"

Vehicle Bravo began to move in the direction of Soum, as far as he could be tracked by Tokonoyan surveillance. 

"You’ve all had Akata’s brief?"

The team nod. 

"Right, lets make this quick and clean. His precise location may not be known, so let’s can out and smoke him out"

### Chapter 32
Soum was close, "just a few more blocks" he thought to himself. He was sticking to main roads, wider and busier making and ambush more obvious and easier to escape. Suddenly someone approaching caught his eye. Was it paranoia or has the TPK zeroed in on his position. 

He can use his implant to neutralise almost anyone, as far as he was aware, but with it being new to him and mostly experimental tech he’d much rather not have to test it in the open. He used it in Sana to try and find his family, but using it on random Tokonoyans is a step too far. 

These thoughts rushed through his head in seconds and in parallel. Even so the suspected TPK was just a few yards away, but he wasn’t looking directly at Soum, more searching through the crowd. That’s when Soum noticed in his hand was a small device. 

Togeshi was holding the implant scanner, low as to reduce detection. As the arrestee seemingly had managed to disable Akata his identification would be slightly more challenging. Ordinarily Akata would simply point an arrow at the citizen to be arrested but this wasn’t so easy on such a busy street and with an implant disabled citizen. So the TPK setup virtual checkpoints, each Peace Keeper would start on opposite sides of the street and walk towards each other scanning citizens for their implant in an agent to identify the intruder. 

His eye met with a tall middle aged man, not Soum thought Togeshi but I’ll scan none the less, he aimed the scanner but there was no response. The scanner was flickering and the blank "typical TPK gear" he thought, "always on the blink". Glancing up he could no longer see the man, looking behind him he saw him turning the corner. Then his scanner suddenly beeped back to life, "a coincidence?" he thought, "I’d better go ask him some questions". Togeshi turned jogged in the direction of the man he caught eyes with, turning the corner he just glimpsed him darting down an alleyway. 

Togeshi ran after him, "Akata notify the TPK..." Akata interrupted him, "I have notified your colleagues, they are en-route".

"That was odd thought Togeshi, Akata has never interrupted a command before. No time to consider that now though". 

He turned the corner to see a neon lights illuminating the long and empty alley with a handful of doorways. "I know you’re here, I have reinforcements arriving, you will be found one way or another, there’s little point in resisting". 

Soum had is back to a concrete staircase, he could hear the TPK officer moving his way down the alleyway. Soum knew he had the power to free himself of this situation, all it would take is to disable Akata in the approaching officer and he’d be able to slip away. It wasn’t so much a question of can, but should he do that? It was clearly immoral to render the officer immobile, even if it was to help him, find his family, where would that end? No, he couldn’t do it. His best bet was to hide and try to slip away. 

### Chapter 33
After being processed Sana was led down a corridor of the TPK headquarters. A grey building, soulless and lacking all character. The honesty of the architecture was almost moving. Sana was directed into a holding room by a TPK officer. 

"Sit there quietly Ms. Itakisum. Someone will be with you shortly"

Sana entered the room, there was a worn sofa a table and a power outlet, connected to which was an implant scanner. It was unlikely the TPK will actually ask her many questions. They would merely scan Akata and draw conclusions from him. 

Sitting down a thought crossed her mind. What if, by disabling Akata, Soum’s actions would give the impression of collusion. 

She shook her head, as if to shake the idea out of her mind. 

The truth will be apparent to the TPK, "I’m sure of it" she murmured to herself. 

"Hmm?", the officer was still in the doorway. 

"Oh, nothing" not realising she was still there Sana gestures a respectful but not too subservient bow. 

Sana entered the room and sat down, the door closed and a voice came through the speakers in the room. 

"Ms. Itakisum, we will commence the Akata scan now"

A later grid swept the room, it located Sana and layered a grid around her head in order to find her implant. Once located a high speed data connection was made and any unique data was instantly downloaded from Sana. 

The entire procedure took a few seconds, what followed took significantly longer. Sana had to wait hours, alone. After which a short, narrow framed officer opened the door and gestured Sana to follow, walking down the corridor in silence they approached a steel door, opening it revealed an interrogation room. Sana walked in and sat at the table, the officer sat opposite and removed his screen from his pocket. 

"Ms. Itskisum, you present a unique conundrum, from your records, work terminal logs and life surveillance you are a model citizen. A dedicated member of the Interior Ministry, living a seemingly blissful existence for the betterment of Tokonoya. On the other hand you have discovered a way to wipe your Akata logs and permanently disable him. Something we’ve only seen achieved by those in the wastes. Would you care to explain?"

Sana went on to explain the encounter with Dr Soum. She made sure she covered off every detail she could remember, fearful that they already knew everything from the Akata scan and that any discrepancies would be seen as intentional misdirection. 

Once she’d finished recounting the officer reviewed his screen closely, after a few moments she could see his screen flash red. He snapped it closed and then stood sharply, please follow me Ms. Itakisum. 

This was not good, Sana could feel it in her stomach.

### Chapter 34
Togeshi marched Soum into the TPK headquarters, pride beaming from his every movement. _He_ had caught TOK87638/f, he knew nothing of the case aside from Akata classing it as a Class 1, which is the most urgent of cases. 

He took TOK87638/f to the processing desk.

"Interrogation room ready?" Togeshi asked. 

"Yep, room 116B, next door to Ms Itakisum, save you a long walk between suspects".

"Wonderful. You’ll be unable to scan this suspects implant so you need to fill the forms in manually. He’s a Class 1 so I’ll get him to the room and wait for the Interior Ministry to arrive, let me know?"

The clerk at the reception nodded as Togeshi walked Soum to the interrogation room next to Sana’s. 

He had no idea what TOK87638/f was in for, but he did now it was the first Class 1 case he’d seen. This was big, and he didn’t want to do anything to mess it up. Togeshi would follow the rules to a t on this one. 

Togeshi marched Soum to room 116B, room A was where Sana was being held, which meant he could process her under the Domestic Terrorism charges and get her out of the way before the Interior Ministry arrived for Soum. 

"It’s a good day to be Togeshi" he mumbled to himself. 

Soum was calm, he’d let himself get caught, using his implant on unsuspecting Tokonoyans should be a last resort. An option which was becoming more and more likely. 

He sat at the metal table in the interrogation room, as Togeshi left the room Soum thought he heard him mentioning Sana Itakisum to a colleague. "That would be an odd twist of fate" Soum thought. He hadn’t yet leaned to master his implant, but ever since it was enabled he had _senses_ about the world around him. Right now he could sense Sana next to him, the signature of her implant was already imprinted in his. He knew, although he may of heard wrong, he could feel that she must be in the room next door. 

"Sana, Akata has reviewed your case", hope lifted Sana’s heart, this should quickly clear up any misunderstanding, "Akata has determined you as a domestic terrorist, disabling your implant to subvert…" Togeshi’s words blurred, Sana couldn’t focus on any of it, once those words "domestic terrorist" were uttered a dread washed over her. She knew what that meant. Tokonoya s labelled at domestic terrorists disappeared. Rumours were that they were often put into labour camps and worked to death. 

A sharp high pitch noise started to grow in her head, she winced as the pain grew to an almost unbearable burning. After a few minutes it began to subside, Sana opened her eyes, the room was empty. Picking herself up off the floor she sat back down at the table, head in hands "what the hell was tha… wait, the door has moved"

She rushed up and felt the wall as if it was masking the real door. How could it be.

"Sana, it’s me, Soum"

Sana turned, she saw no one else in the room, and yet Soum’s voice was right next to her. Then the realisation began to dawn, she was _in_ Soum.

"Sana, I am in the room next to yours, I sensed your implant and wanted to try and communicate with it, I didn’t realise this would happen but I’m glad it did, we need to talk, I fear for your life Sana, these TPK are just the servants of Akata, they have no interest in the truth, no principles, they just do what Akata tells them for an easy life and just enough tokens to keep them quiet".

"You need to get out of here, I can help, but it needs to be now".

Sana thought for a minute, she’d issues enough warrants to know that domestic terrorists are at the very least, never heard of again. Soums words were hard to hear, there was a mixture of hard truths as well as things that had become apparent to her. She couldn’t help but feel some of the comments Soum made were an attack on her. One thing was certain, there was no easy way out of this situation, and Soum’s implant was far superior than she every realised. 

### Chapter 35

Zhou had decided to divulge Gerintek’s and his work to the shareholders. That meeting would be in two weeks but he wanted to talk to Gerintek and see how they could package this discovery as a product. Of course the idea of providing it for free crossed his mind as he mulled over the implications of their venture, but it would all too quickly become too expensive to manage and maintain. He needed more details from Gerintek before deciding what to do.

He arrived to her lab and sat down on an office chair, leaning back and grinning whilst she finished off whatever it was she was working on. Typing away furiously she raised a finger to indicate she’s almost complete.

"You look better today Zhou, I was a tad worried when you left, looked paler than usual!"

"Yeah, I quickly came to realise that this is a wonderful development, a gift to all the Free People, immortality, just saying it makes me feel almost silly, but it’s true".

"It is very much true Zhou, like I was saying yesterday, I think it’d be easily possible to transfer someone’s consciousness into a screen too. Currently I think we’re limited to transferring rather than cloning though". 

Zhou raised is eyebrows indicating Gerintek should continue. 

"Yeah, that’s where we went wrong with the first few attempts, the original host was fine but the cloned consciousness was corrupt. The last ditch attempt with Soum was an all or nothing, we transferred his entire consciousness onto our modified implant. Then extracted the implant and to our surprise, and relief, Soum was intact!"

"So what is it about our implants that allow us to do this?"

"Well, it took some serious innovation Zhou, I know my lab has sucked up a lot of resources, what we have developed is a breakthrough in implant hardware, which has unlocked a new generation of software".

"This prototype implant uses a neural, decentralised architecture that can store a living consciousness. We then have written software which maps the hosts neurology, and neurone by neurone transfers the host to the implant".

Zhou clapped his hands and smiled. 

"This is it Gerintek. This new implant is the Grail".

After some more conversation Zhou assured Gerintek that he would convince the shareholders to provide her with whatever funding and resources she needed. Not only has this secured the future of the company, it’s secured the future of all Free People. Again the ideas almost lifted him off the floor.  


He left the lab and immediately asked his implant to schedule a shareholders meeting. He’d instructed Gerintek to continue her research specifically focusing on solidifying the prototype into a product that can be mass produced. Zhou’s wording of the meeting invite resulted in rapid replies from all the major shareholders. Next week he’d reveal their innovation. 

### Chapter 36

"Ok Soum, what do you propose?"

"I can try and disable your TPK captures to allow you to escape, however Akata will be able to track you with ease unless I also disable your implant. The only option I can think of is to get you out of the building, then disable Akata and take you to a Free People’s operative myself".

Sana’s stomach churned, she’s spend her life hunting down Free People’s operatives and spies in Tokonoya. This would seal her fate as a domestic terrorist in Tokonoya, she’d have to leave and join those huddled in the wastes. She hesitated for a moment to think of an alternative, her mind was severely conflicted and close to breakdown. Was her hesitation even her own? Or Akata infiltrating her thoughts and bending them. The paranoia was strong, she cut through it like a knife with a single, simple decision. 

"Yes, let’s do it!"

Soum disconnected from Sana and waited to hear her door open, whilst her body remained limp in the room next door the TPK had called on a medic to see to her. Nothing could be planned, Soum just had to act on instinct, or perhaps he was just trusting his implant. 

He focused on controlling is implant, disabled the first TPK to enter the room.

Sana watched in amazement as the medic entering the room just froze, she could see their eyes moving frantically. She knew all too well what that felt like. Leaning out of the room she could see a long corridor terminating in a T junction, there was a guard outside Soum’s room, also frozen still. She hesitantly steps out, Sana can see the guards eyes focus on her but he still doesn’t move. Shake in Sana moves the guards hand to the door handle and opens it, swinging it firmly from the other side Soum appears in the doorway.

"Let’t go!"

With little resistance they manage to rush out of the building, Sana just blindly followed Soum until suddenly she could see the sky and smell the warm, damp city. 

"It’s time Sana, Akata will be alerting all networks of your escape".

A Soum controlled taxi stops in front of them, the door opens. Soum smiles at Sana before beginning the exercise of disabling Akata when suddenly a load crack echoed out. Sana’s body was thrown forward. Soum looked around and could see a team of 4 TPK in full military regalia aiming at him too. He focuses with all his energy on them, they freeze in place unable to move. Then Soum drags Sana into the taxi and instructs it to drive to Meera, he overrides the speed limit control and disables the Akata module. 

"Sana?"

She looked lifeless, he felt for a pulse, nothing. 

Soum then did the only thing he could think of, connect to her the way he did in the cells. 

Sana opened her eyes, she looked down and almost blacked out. There she was, dead on her lap, well, on Soum’s lap.
